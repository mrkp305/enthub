            <p>
                Don't misuse our Services. For example, don't interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don't remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.

            <p>
                Our Services display some content that is not from EntHub. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don't assume that we do.
            </p>
            <p>
                In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.

              <p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We'll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We'll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.</p>

              <p>If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.</p>
                
              <p>These terms control the relationship between EntHub and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.</p>

              <p>If you do not comply with these terms, and we don't take action right away, this doesn't mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</p>

              <p>If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</p>
              <p>The laws that is used in Zimbabwe, excluding will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to these terms or the Services.</p>

            <h4 class="headline margin-top-40 margin-bottom-25">Resolving Disputes</h4>
    
              <p>Informal Resolution. We want to address your concerns without needing a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against EntHub, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us. We'll try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email. If a dispute is not resolved within 15 days of submission, you or EntHub may bring a formal proceeding.</p>

              <p>We Both Agree To Arbitrate. You and EntHub agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or the Services through final and binding arbitration, except as set forth under Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate below.</p>
                
              <p>Arbitration Procedures. The Zimbabwe Arbitration Association (ZAA) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. The arbitration will be held in Harare Zimbabwe, where you live or work, Bulawayo, Masvingo, Mutare, or any other location we agree to.</p>

              <p>Arbitration Fees and Incentives. The ZAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees and attorneys' fees.                </p>

              <p>
                    Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate. Either party may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.
              </p>
              <p>No Class Actions. You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations aren't allowed.</p>
              <p>
                    Judicial forum for disputes. In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your claim, you and EntHub agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the magistrate courts with jurisdiction over Harare, Zimbabwe. Both you and EntHub consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.
